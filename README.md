# Sensor Network Proj
### Sensor Network with Web Access
Remote monitoring and data logging system with a broader scope of capabilities, without significant increase in price. Applications are: telemetry of a micro-grid, household energy consumption monitoring and general Internet of Things applications.

System capabilities:
* Monitor Large quantity of sensors (50 and more)
* Sensor type flexibility - support for analog, digital and pulse type sensors
* Remote monitoring - accesses to sensors within 100m radius
* Network access - user interface provided in form of a web-page 
* Real time viewing  of sensor data 
* Storing data for research purposes
* Ability to add, remove and configure sensors through the user-interface

Description:
New system uses both Arduino, as well as, Raspberry Pi development platforms, and it is modular. 
By assigning each module with a separate task, we can fully exploit their strengths. 
Arduino boards are excellent for driving sensors, reading data and converting analog inputs to digital value. 
While Raspberry Pi, with its powerful operating system, can host a server and allow remote data access.
